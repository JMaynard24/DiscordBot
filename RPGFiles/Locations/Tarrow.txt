traineropening: "Looking to better yourself? I assure you, you've come to the right man."

trainerrumor+: "The Iodran Vanguard has been pulling many warriors like myself out of retirement of late. They say there's some rising threat or other, and we are to ensure that no man is unprepared for what is ahead. They are apprehensive to give any details, though. Very ominous..."
trainerrumor+: "You sought guidance from an elderly gentleman whilst imprisoned? The way you describe him sounds familiar... I feel we may have fought beside one another some years past. It sounds as though he's undergone a change of heart."
